# By default HETATM is deleted. If user need HETATM for ligand/ion binding
# Set 1st "F", 3rd "T". And make HETATM in correct PQR format.
Remove HETATM                      : T
Remove water molecule              : T
HETATM in PQR format               : F

# For protonation only, set 2nd and 3rd options "F". Otherwise, all "T"
